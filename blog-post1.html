            <h3 class="mt-3">What is carbon emission?</h3>
            <p>
              Emissions[Carbon Emissions] means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. Carbon dioxide emissions or CO2 emissions are emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement; they include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels as well as gas flaring.
Around 50 Gt of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere each year (6.6 Gt per person) and for 2019 those emissions are expected to total 57 Gt CO2 eq, including 5 Gt from changes in land use. In 2019, the energy supply sector accounted for over 34% [20 GtCO2-eq] of all net anthropogenic GHG emissions, followed by industry (24% [14 GtCO2-eq], agricultural, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) (22% [13 GtCO2-eq), transportation (15% [8.7 GtCO2-eq], and buildings (6% [3.3 GtCO2-eq]). 
<br>
<br>
There are several ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions. Some variables that have been reported include:
<br>
⮚	Measurement boundaries: Emissions can be linked geographically to either the territory they originated from (the territory principle) or the territory that produced them (the activity concept). When calculating totals for things like electricity imports between nations or emissions at an international airport, these two methods lead to different results.
<br>
⮚	Time horizon of different gases: A specific greenhouse gas's contribution is expressed as a CO2 equivalent. This computation takes into account the amount of time the gas is in the atmosphere. Since this is not always known with certainty[clarification required], computations must be modified frequently to account for new knowledge.
<br>
⮚	The measurement protocol itself: This could be done through estimation or direct measurement. The mass balance method, continuous emissions monitoring systems, predictive emissions monitoring systems, and emission factor-based methods are the four basic approaches. In terms of accuracy, price, and utility, these methods vary. Before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, climate-based measurements of carbon dioxide by Climate Trace were anticipated to make specific major plants public.
<br>
<br>
The main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are:
<br>
●	burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air.
<br>
●	land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) accounts for about a quarter of total anthropogenic GHG emissions.
<br>
●	livestock enteric fermentation and manure management, paddy rice farming, land use and wetland changes, man-made lakes, pipeline losses, and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations. Many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process are also sources of atmospheric methane.
<br>
●	use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration systems, and use of CFCs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes.
<br>
●	agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers, that lead to higher nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations.
<br>
<br>
The major sources of Greenhouse gases (GHG) are:
<br>
❖	Land Use (CO2 emissions)
<br>
❖	Forestry (CO2-LULUCF)
<br>
❖	Nitrous Acid (N2O)
<br>
❖	Fluorinated gases (F-gases)
<br>
❖	Compromising hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
<br>
❖	Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
<br>
❖	sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)
<br>
❖	nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)
