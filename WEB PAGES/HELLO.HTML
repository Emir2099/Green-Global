<h2>Why We Should Recycle ?</h2>
<h3>Recycling helps protect the environment</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Recycling lessens the need for raw materials to be extracted, refined, and processed, 
    all of which lead to pollution of the air and water.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;">Recycling not only saves energy but also lowers greenhouse gas emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change.</p>  
<h3>Recycling conserves resources</h3>  
<p>Recycling allows us to reuse things and cut down on the consumption 
    of natural resources, helping to preserve natural environments for the long term.</p>
<h3>Recycling reduces landfill</h3> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Recycling results in the reprocessing of recyclable materials into new goods, which minimises the amount of waste transported to 
    landfills and, consequently,</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;">the emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>
<h2>Types Of Recycling</h2>
<h3>E-waste recycling</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;"> Not only is recycling gadgets beneficial to the environment, but it is also required.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;"> You risk receiving a citation if you dispose of them in your regular trash because</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;"> they contain hazardous materials. The simplest method to protect the environment is to locate a</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px;"> local facility that recycles electronics and accepts other types of e-waste.</p>
<p>Most E-waste recycling facilityies will accept the following articles :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computer</li>
    <li>Laptop</li>
    <li>Smart Phones</li>
    <li>Cell Phones</li>
    <li>Stereos</li>
    <li>Printer</li>
    <li>Small Applinces</li>
  </ul>  
    
<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">For every million laptops recycled, we save enough energy to power over 3,600 homes. Not only does it save energy,</p> 
<p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;">it prevents pollution and reduces landfills.The USA generates a staggering 9.4 million tons of e-waste every year.</p>  
<p style="margin-top:0px;">  You can help put an end to that now by finding an electronics recycling center near you.</p>
<h3>Plastic</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Calibri; font-size:16px";>Recycling just one tonne of plastic saves 5,774 kWh of electricity, 685 gallons of oil, and 98 million BTUs of energy.
And by reusing drink containers like water bottles, you can save up to 100 disposable bottles every year.
So if you’re wondering how to recycle plastic bottles at home and help the environment, you’re doing the right thing.
The problem is that the process is a bit confusing. There are so many types of plastic, so many regulations, and not enough good information.
This drives a lot of people to give up and throw it away.
    
So where can you probably find a place to recycle plastics? The solution is right in your own home.
by reusing the plastics as containers to store various household items or to make creative
art pieces such as pen holders, and there could be many other uses. However, if you don’t want that, you can go to a nearby grocery store.
and return bottles to get your deposit back for beverages. You can also locate your city’s transfer station and use their recycling facility.
That’s most likely the easiest and most comprehensive way to handle bulk materials.
    
Less than one-third of eligible plastic is recycled in the USA. Together, we can help bring that number to 100%!</pre>
<h3> Scrap metal recycling</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Calibri;">Before you throw that item in the trash, you might want to consider if it has any valuable scrap metal in it. Don’t believe us? 
The scrap metal industry was valued at $64 billion dollars in 2010!Zinc, copper, gold, steel, and aluminum are all valuable materials, 
and many household items contain them. The only thing you need to know is which ones to recycle and how much they are worth.
Learning how to recycle scrap metal and finding a facility near you provides powerful economic benefits.
    
Determining if your metal is valuable is rather easy. All you need is a magnet. 
If the metal sticks to the magnet, it is “ferrous” and not valuable. If it doesn’t stick, it is “non-ferrous”. 
These metals can fetch a decent chunk of change. Separate your scraps into these two categories. Both should be recycled.
    
The most common metals you will come across are:
    <b> ▶ copper:</b> Copper is extremely valuable. Stripping the copper from wires with wire strippers is a good idea. 
                   You can tell if it is in good shape because of its reddish hue.
                   <br>
    <b>▶ Brass:</b> Common in light fixtures, keys, and locks, brass can also fetch a pretty penny.
    <br>
    <b>▶ Steel:</b> Steel won’t be worth much, but it should always be recycled. Be sure to use the magnet test to make sure it is steel. 
                 A magnet will stick to it very easily. Always bring it to a metal recycling facility near you.
                 <br>
    <b>▶ Aluminum:</b> common building material used in siding, windows, wire, car parts, and industrial parts. 
                      Aluminum does not have strong magnetic properties and can usually be identified 
                      if it does not stick to a magnet.

Separate your scraps and find a metal recycling facility close to you immediately. You can make some good money and help the environment!

<h3> Glass recycling</h3>
<pre style="font-family:Calibri;"> glass can be recycled endlessly without sacrificing quality.Recycled glass bottles can be used in place of 95% of raw materials, 
meaning all efforts to reuse it save precious materials from being wasted. Did you know that for every ton of glass recycled, over a ton of natural resources is saved?
    
If you’re wondering if it’s worth returning those bottles you’ve got at home, you should know that deposits add up quickly. Many states have bottle deposits that can pay 
back up to 10 cents for each bottle. So if you’ve had a big party or have just accumulated a bunch of bottles over the past few weeks, toss them all in your car and 
hustle over to a glass bottle recycling center near you.
    
Most grocery stores in your town will have a glass recycling machine. Be sure to separate by color, as this will help the process on both ends—for you and for the facility. 
Be sure to clean the bottles first before returning them, and be prepared to stand in line!
Since the process is time intensive, we recommend waiting until you’ve got a large collection saved up. Once you’ve got more bags than you can handle, 
it’s time to get to a glass bottle recycling facility near you.
