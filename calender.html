The UK Garden bird population may be seen in the birdwatcher's snapshot of time. The RSPB can compare the outcomes with earlier years because it is held at around the same time each year. <br><br>

The Climate Coalition is in charge of this anti-climate change effort. This is the biggest coalition fighting climate change in the UK.

Every year on February 2nd, World Wetlands Day is observed to promote awareness of wetlands. Particularly, the vital importance of these threatened ecosystems' contributions to biodiversity, climatic adaptability and mitigation, freshwater supply, global economies, and other factors.

Since the 1700s, wetlands all over the world have deteriorated by around 90%. In addition, wetlands are disappearing three times quicker than forests. As a result, this awareness day aims to increase wetlands' visibility on a national and international scale, slow down their rapid destruction, and promote conservation and restoration efforts. <br> <br>

As a result, more people become aware of the frequently exploited and underpaid workers in our supply chains and the value of adopting Fair Trade. <br><br>
