  <h1>What Is[are] carbon emissions?</h1>
  <section class="c1">
  <p>Emissions[Carbon Emissions] means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. Carbon dioxide emissions or CO2 emissions are emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement; they include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels as well as gas flaring.
    Around 50 Gt of greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere each year (6.6 Gt per person) and for 2019 those emissions are expected to total 57 Gt CO2 eq, including 5 Gt from changes in land use. [10] In 2019, the energy supply sector accounted for over 34% [20 GtCO2-eq] of all net anthropogenic GHG emissions, followed by industry (24% [14 GtCO2-eq], agricultural, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) (22% [13 GtCO2-eq), transportation (15% [8.7 GtCO2-eq], and buildings (6% [3.3 GtCO2-eq]).

  <h3>How is carbon emissions measured</h3>
  <p>There are several ways of measuring greenhouse gas emissions. Some variables that have been reported include:<br>
    ⮚	Measurement boundaries: Emissions can be linked geographically to either the territory they originated from (the territory principle) or the territory that produced them (the activity concept). When calculating totals for things like electricity imports between nations or emissions at an international airport, these two methods lead to different results.
    <br>
    ⮚	Time horizon of different gases: A specific greenhouse gas's contribution is expressed as a CO2 equivalent. This computation takes into account the amount of time the gas is in the atmosphere. Since this is not always known with certainty[clarification required], computations must be modified frequently to account for new knowledge.
    <br>
    ⮚	The measurement protocol itself: This could be done through estimation or direct measurement. The mass balance method, continuous emissions monitoring systems, predictive emissions monitoring systems, and emission factor-based methods are the four basic approaches. In terms of accuracy, price, and utility, these methods vary. Before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, climate-based measurements of carbon dioxide by Climate Trace are[were] anticipated to make specific major plants public.

  <h3>Main sources of carbon emission</h3>
  <p>The main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are:
    <br>
    ●	burning of fossil fuels and deforestation leading to higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the air.
    <br>
    ●	land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) accounts for about a quarter of total anthropogenic GHG emissions.
    <br>
    ●	livestock enteric fermentation and manure management, paddy rice farming, land use and wetland changes, man-made lakes, pipeline losses, and covered vented landfill emissions leading to higher methane atmospheric concentrations. Many of the newer style fully vented septic systems that enhance and target the fermentation process also are[are also] sources of atmospheric methane.
    <br>
    ●	use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration systems, and use of CFCs and halons in fire suppression systems and manufacturing processes.
    <br>
    ●	agricultural activities, including the use of fertilizers, that lead to higher nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations.

    <h1>How carbon emission effect[affect] the world(</h1>
    <p>1.Climate change:
        The greenhouse effect is supported by science and data, despite the fact that it is a current global hot topic. Like a genuine greenhouse, the greenhouse effect traps gases from the Earth's atmosphere in the warmth of the sun.
        In essence, greenhouse gases trap heat on the globe. As emissions rise, their impact on the atmosphere and consequent impact on global temperatures grow.
        
        The combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions during the past 150 years, which is primarily attributable to human activity, according to the EPA.
        As discussed, carbon dioxide is one of the biggest contributors to the changes in our atmosphere and greenhouse gases overall. Even though it takes up a small percentage, less than 1%, of the total atmosphere, humans are releasing CO2 at unprecedented numbers, causing massive changes in our temperatures and climate. As our CO2 emissions and temperatures on Earth rise, this creates a domino effect across our entire ecosystem, including plant life, human and animal life, ocean life and our planet’s weather patterns.
        <br>
        2.Impact on plants:
        Increased carbon dioxide levels’ impact on plants are[is] both understood and accepted, yet still controversial within the scientific community.
        According to a NASA study, increased atmospheric CO2 levels have an impact on crops and plants by speeding up photosynthesis and lowering transpiration water loss. The plant's stomata, or small holes, don't open as widely when carbon dioxide levels rise. Faster photosynthesis and fewer water loss results from this, which, in principle, should increase water efficiency.
        The controversy or argument in the scientific community stems from whether increased CO2 for plants is actually beneficial overall for production and nutrients. One argument, made by Richard Norby, states that while isolating a leaf in a laboratory there is no doubt that an increase in CO2 leads to an increase in photosynthesis. However, what these studies lack is the addition of other outside factors that contribute to plant growth. The questions primarily focus on nitrogen levels, because if nitrogen levels are in short supply the benefit of CO2 increases in plants becomes limited.
        <br>
        3.Impact on humans and animals:
        At the current rate, this high level of CO2 doesn’t have a direct effect on humans, but the side effects it causes on nature could be detrimental in the longer-term if major efforts are not made to slow carbon emissions down.
        Some of the major long-term effects are:
        <br>
        ●	Heat Waves – Already the deadliest extreme weather type, an increase in CO2 directly leads to increased Earth temperatures. The hotter it gets, the tougher it will be to survive.
        <br>
        ●	Pollution – Pollution currently kills 9 million people per year. Higher levels of CO2 increase pollution levels worldwide, leading to more human deaths for every degree increased.
        <br>
        ●	Insect Plagues – Warmer weather increases the arrival of mosquitos, ticks and other disease-carrying insects. These pests expand their territory and remain longer before the cold weather removes them, essentially increasing the potential victims of their diseases.
        <br>
        ●	Hurricanes, Fires and Other Natural Disasters – As the Earth gets warmer the ice melts, causing increased water levels. This ultimately impacts our natural weather patterns, causing an increase in hurricanes and large storms. Another effect of warmer weather is an increase in forest fires burning for a longer period because the trees and vegetation are dryer and more flammable.
        
        <br>
        4.Impact on oceans:
        Nearly one-fourth of all CO2 emissions are absorbed by and fixed in ocean plants by ocean vegetation. Similar to land plants, these plants absorb CO2, however the majority of the CO2 ends up dissolving into the oceans, contributing to ocean acidification.
        The long-term impact of ocean acidification includes the dissolving of our ocean’s natural coral reefs that may eventually lead to their extinction if CO2 levels continue to rise. The increased acid levels also impact shellfish. We see the corrosive water start to deteriorate their shells before they are able to mature, causing lasting damage.
        The polar ice caps are melting into the oceans as a result of rising CO2 levels and the Earth's warmth. Our beachfront wetlands and sea fronts are lowered by rising water levels. Since all ocean life is used to the existing salinity levels, the melting of fresh water ice causes the salinity of the salty sea water to decrease.
        </p>
        <h3>Final thoughts on carbon emissions</h3>
        <p>There are numerous long term and detrimental side effects to the planet if humans continue to produce and release high levels of CO2 into the atmosphere every day.
            The majority of the planet’s population can do their part in contributing to lowering their own personal levels of CO2 emissions, and lobby our governments and larger corporations to adopt these same goals. The recent climate global protests, coinciding with Greta Thunberg’s warnings of a climate apocalypse, bear testament to the concerns felt by the current global population. Scientists predict that if our global temperatures rise just 1.5 degrees Celsius, it could be extremely destructive to our planet and all those who depend on it.

        <h1>Steps to prevent carbon emission</h1>
        <p> ●	Switch it Off
            <br>
            Turn off the lights when natural light is sufficient and when you leave the room. It’s that simple!
            <br>
            ●	Climate Control
            <br>
            Keep your temperature system on a moderate setting while you’re in the room.
            <br>
            ●	Wasteful Windows
            <br>
            Use your windows wisely! If your climate control system is on, shut them…if you need a little fresh air, turn off the heat or AC.
            <br>
            ●	Minimize Plug Load
            <br>
            Cut down the number of appliances you are running and you will save big on[a lot of] energy. For example, share your minifridge with roommates and minimize the number of printers in your office.
            <br>
            ●	Phantom Power
            <br>
            Did you know that many electronics continue using energy even when powered down? This is true of any charger, television, printer, etc. Use a power strip to easily unplug these electronics when not in use.
            <br>
            ●	Give it a Rest
            <br>
            Power off your computer down when you’re away. A computer turned off uses at least 65% less energy than a computer left on or idle on a screen saver.
            <br>
            ●	Take the Stairs
            <br>
            Use the stairs as often as possible. Elevators consume electricity. You, on the other hand, do not.
            <br>
            ●	Loaded Laundry
            <br>
            Only do full loads of laundry and use the bright colors cycle whenever possible.
            <br>
            ●	Shorter Showers
            <br>
            Try to take shorter showers. The less hot water you use, the less energy is needed to heat the water.
            <br>
            ●	Switch to CFLs
            <br>
            Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use 75% less energy than incandescent and last up to 10 times longer.
            <br>
            ●	Conserve Paper
            <br>
            Print and copy on two sides, save single-sided pages for notes, and print only what you need.
            <br>
            ●	Recycle
            <br>
            Take a few steps to a recycling centre in your building to deposit aluminium cans, plastics, glass, office paper, newspaper, cardboard. Pickup of office electronics, bulk metal and surplus furniture can be arranged by contacting Facilities Work Management.
            <br>
            ●	Promote Reuse
            <br>
            Donate used cell phones and chargers, furniture clothing and cleaning and school supplies.
            <br>
            ●	Get a Little Exercise
            <br>
            Consider walking or riding a bike to campus if the distance is reasonable. Walk from your bus or subway stop to your office or lab. Faculty and staff car poolers pay reduced or no fee to park on campus, depending on size of carpool.
