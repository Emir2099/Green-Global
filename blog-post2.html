            <p>
                <strong>1.Climate change:</strong>
                <br>
                The greenhouse effect is supported by science and data, despite the fact that it is a current global hot topic. Like a genuine greenhouse, the greenhouse effect traps gases from the Earth's atmosphere in the warmth of the sun.
                In essence, greenhouse gases trap heat on the globe. As emissions rise, their impact on the atmosphere and consequent impact on global temperatures grow.
                <br>
                The combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions during the past 150 years, which is primarily attributable to human activity, according to the EPA.
                As discussed, carbon dioxide is one of the biggest contributors to the changes in our atmosphere and greenhouse gases overall. Even though it takes up a small percentage, less than 1%, of the total atmosphere, humans are releasing CO2 at unprecedented numbers, causing massive changes in our temperatures and climate. As our CO2 emissions and temperatures on Earth rise, this creates a domino effect across our entire ecosystem, including plant life, human and animal life, ocean life and our planet’s weather patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>2.Impact on plants:</strong>
                <br>
                Increased carbon dioxide levels’ impact on plants are[is] both understood and accepted, yet still controversial within the scientific community.
                According to a NASA study, increased atmospheric CO2 levels have an impact on crops and plants by speeding up photosynthesis and lowering transpiration water loss. The plant's stomata, or small holes, don't open as widely when carbon dioxide levels rise. Faster photosynthesis and fewer water loss results from this, which, in principle, should increase water efficiency.
                The controversy or argument in the scientific community stems from whether increased CO2 for plants is actually beneficial overall for production and nutrients. One argument, made by Richard Norby, states that while isolating a leaf in a laboratory there is no doubt that an increase in CO2 leads to an increase in photosynthesis. However, what these studies lack is the addition of other outside factors that contribute to plant growth. The questions primarily focus on nitrogen levels, because if nitrogen levels are in short supply the benefit of CO2 increases in plants becomes limited.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>3.Impact on humans and animals:</strong>
                <br>
                At the current rate, this high level of CO2 doesn’t have a direct effect on humans, but the side effects it causes on nature could be detrimental in the longer-term if major efforts are not made to slow carbon emissions down.
                <br>
                Some of the major long-term effects are:
                <br>
                ●	Heat Waves – Already the deadliest extreme weather type, an increase in CO2 directly leads to increased Earth temperatures. The hotter it gets, the tougher it will be to survive.
                <br>
                ●	Pollution – Pollution currently kills 9 million people per year. Higher levels of CO2 increase pollution levels worldwide, leading to more human deaths for every degree increased.
                <br>
                ●	Insect Plagues – Warmer weather increases the arrival of mosquitos, ticks and other disease-carrying insects. These pests expand their territory and remain longer before the cold weather removes them, essentially increasing the potential victims of their diseases.
                <br>
                ●	Hurricanes, Fires and Other Natural Disasters – As the Earth gets warmer the ice melts, causing increased water levels. This ultimately impacts our natural weather patterns, causing an increase in hurricanes and large storms. Another effect of warmer weather is an increase in forest fires burning for a longer period because the trees and vegetation are dryer and more flammable.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>4.Impact on oceans:</strong>
                <br>
                Nearly one-fourth of all CO2 emissions are absorbed by and fixed in ocean plants by ocean vegetation. Similar to land plants, these plants absorb CO2, however the majority of the CO2 ends up dissolving into the oceans, contributing to ocean acidification.
                The long-term impact of ocean acidification includes the dissolving of our ocean’s natural coral reefs that may eventually lead to their extinction if CO2 levels continue to rise. The increased acid levels also impact shellfish. We see the corrosive water start to deteriorate their shells before they are able to mature, causing lasting damage.
                The polar ice caps are melting into the oceans as a result of rising CO2 levels and the Earth's warmth. Our beachfront wetlands and sea fronts are lowered by rising water levels. Since all ocean life is used to the existing salinity levels, the melting of fresh water ice causes the salinity of the salty sea water to decrease.
